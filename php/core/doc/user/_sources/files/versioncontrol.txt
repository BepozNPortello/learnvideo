Version Control
===============

ownCloud supports simple version control for files. Versioning is
enabled by default, and creates backups of files which are accessible
via the history tab. This tab also links to the history page, where you
can roll back a file to any previous version. Changes made at intervals
greater than two minutes are saved in data/[user]/versions, and made
accessible using the above pages.
