Linux Distributions
-------------------

This section describes the installation process for different
distributions. If there are pre-made packages from ownCloud,
you are encouraged to prefer those over the vendor-provided
ones, since they usually are more up-to-date.

Archlinux
~~~~~~~~~
There are two AUR packages for ownCloud:

-  `stable version`_
-  `development version`_

.. _stable version: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=47585
.. _development version: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=38767

openSUSE
~~~~~~~~

.. note:: ready-to-use SLES and openSUSE RPM packages are available in the openSUSE Build Service `ownCloud repository`_.

#. Copy ownCloud to Apache's server directory : **/srv/www/htdocs**
#. Give the web server the necessary permissions:

::

  sudo chown -R wwwrun owncloud

3. Open the folder in a browser and complete the setup wizard

If have followed the steps above and want to try it out, run this
command in a terminal to start Apache if itâ€™s not already running::

  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start

Go to http://servername/owncloud and walk through the setup.

Fedora
~~~~~~

.. note:: ready-to-use RPM packages are available in the openSUSE Build Service `ownCloud repository`_.

Make sure `SELinux is disabled <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SELinux_FAQ#How_do_I_enable_or_disable_SELinux_.3F>`_ or else the installation process will fail with the following message::

  Config file (config/config.php) is not writable for the webserver

Configure Apache:

#. If you already have a website running from Document Root but would still like to install OwnCloud you can use a Name-based virtual host entry and subdomain.
#. Edit your DNS record following this example: **point owncloud.foo.com > ip.ip.ip.ip**


CentOS 5 & 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: ready-to-use CentOS RPM packages are available
          in the openSUSE Build Service `ownCloud repository`_.

1. Create a new file in **/etc/httpd/conf/** and call it **owncloud.conf**.
2. You can use the following as an example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <IfModule mod_alias.c>
    Alias /owncloud /var/www/owncloud/
    </IfModule>
    <Directory /var/www/owncloud/>
       Options None
       Order allow,deny
       allow from all
    </Directory>
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin foo@foofarm.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/owncloud
        ServerName owncloud.foo.com
        ErrorLog logs/owncloud.foo.info-error_log
        CustomLog logs/owncloud.foo.info-access_log common

    </VirtualHost>

3. Now edit your httpd.conf file which is usually located in :file:`/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`
4. Add the following to the bottom

::

  Include /etc/httpd/conf/owncloud.conf

5. Restart apache and now when you point your browser to http://owncloud.foo.com it should properly load without affecting http://foo.com

Gentoo
~~~~~~
Set up a standard web server (see instructions above). Then change permissions::

  chown -R apache:apache owncloud

Allow .htaccess, modify :file:`/etc/apache2/vhosts.d/00_default_vhost.conf` and
make sure it contains the following section

.. code-block:: xml

    <Directory /var/www/localhost/htdocs/owncloud>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>

PCLinuxOS
~~~~~~~~~

Follow the Tutorial `ownCloud, installation and setup`_ on the PCLinuxOS web site.

Ubuntu / Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go to the `linux package sources`_ page and execute the steps as described there for your distribution.
